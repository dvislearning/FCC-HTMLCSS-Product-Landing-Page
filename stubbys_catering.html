				<p class="stubby-paragraph">Erasmus and Jolene Stubby moved to California from St. Louis, Missouri, with one dream-- to share his family’s BBQ recipe with the Golden State.  After working  various odd jobs at a uranium mine, he decided to try his hand at politics.  Unfortunately, Erasmus couldn’t resist the temptations of various “gifts,” which led to his eventual impeachment and conviction.  Undeterred, he decided to return to his first loves, delicious ribs, briskets, and chicken!</p>

				<p class="stubby-paragraph">The Stubbys built their first restaurant in Palmdale, California.  At first times were tough.  They had amazing meats, but not many people knew about it, because Palmdale, at the time, was nothing more than a collection of dirt roads and Joshua Trees.  It wasn’t until Ricky Ricardo himself,  Desi Arnaz, drove through the desert one day, and got lost in Palmdale while scouting locations for the latest Desilu Studios feature film.</p>

				<p class="stubby-paragraph">What happened next was described by Arnaz in his autobiography I’ve Got Some ‘Splaning to Do!</p>

				<p class="stubby-paragraph">It was 110 degrees outside and I was almost out of gas.  I couldn’t see anything or anyone for miles away.  I honestly thought I was a goner! But over to my left, next to an abandoned World War II munitions field, I first discovered Stubby’s BBQ.  Having taken a bite out of that tender, perfectly smoked brisket, I thought to myself ‘wow, here I was thinking I was going to die, but instead Ive gone to BBQ heaven.’</p>


				<p class="stubby-paragraph">Arnaz went back to Hollywood, and told everyone about his experience. Word spread quickly  and soon, Stubbys was the talk of the town! Celebrities, sports stars, poets, and even the good ‘ol Joe  quickly fell in love with Stubby’s!</p>

				<p class="stubby-paragraph">And now, almost almost 70 years later, the love affair continues.  Stubby’s still offers the finest BBQ in the country, delivered straight to you through our award-winning catering service.  Check out our menu below, and let Stubby’s cater your next get together!</p>
